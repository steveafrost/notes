## Notes

-   As the complexity of the app grows, it gets harder to keep all the logic in your head at any time. This happens quickly. Once the app is too much to remember, unit testing can help verify the logic in individual pieces, aka units.
-   Reduces bugs as new features are introduced since tests can be run against the entire codebase each deploy.
-   Improve design & encourages refactoring by removing unnecessary logic which increases complexity and in turn increases difficulty of writing tests.
-   Heightened confidence in the codebase since it is all being tested.
